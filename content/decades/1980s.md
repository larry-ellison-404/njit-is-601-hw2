## Page Title
Personal Computing Takes Off


### Description

In March 1982, the US Department of Defense declared TCP/IP to be its official
standard, and a transition plan was outlined for its deployment by January 1983.

Riding the wave of technical innovation from the [1970s](/content/decades/1970s.md),
the 1980's were also marked by a widespread adoption of personal computing.

During this time, the two biggest names in consumer computing also IPO-ed on the stock market:
  - On December 12, 1980: Apple was listed on the stock market
  - On March 13, 1986: Microsoft began trading on the stock market

Then, in October 1984, Apple released the Macintosh 128K. It was the first successful
mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface, built-in screen, and mouse.

Then, in November 1985, Microsoft released its first retail version of Microsoft Windows (Windows 1.0).

And with this, the American consumer had to ask one of the universe's most difficult questions: Mac or PC?

Regardless of which choice was made, the  number of personal computers in American homes would grow throughout
this decade, setting the stage for the mass adoption of the world wide web in the [1990s](/content/decades/1990s.md).
