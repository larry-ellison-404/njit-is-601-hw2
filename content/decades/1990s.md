This is how we grew it


### Description
As we enter the 1990s we will see the internet start to take shape into what it is today. Many major household names like
Microsoft, Amazon, and eBay became major players in the world of computing and the internet during the 90s. However 
one of the most important decision ever made about the future of the internet occured on June 9th 1992. On that day congress
passed a bill taking the internet out of the exclusive hads of the government and into the hands of the public. A year 
after the decision to take the internet out of the hands of the government Marc Andreessen developed one of the worlds first
graphical web browsers. To put in perspective how important Andreessen's browser was there were only 50 web pages that existed
on the internet but after the release of his browser the web grew by 341,000%.
