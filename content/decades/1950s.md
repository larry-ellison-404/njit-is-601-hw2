The Dawn of the Internet


### Description
To start our journey we are going to travel to the not so distant past of the
1950's where a psychology professor at MIT, JCR Licklider was helping fund a project known 
as the ARPANET which was esentially the first verson of the internet. From there the internet grew
at a reletively steady pace as people like Lenoard Kleinrock made advancements in computing.
Kleinrock was a graduate student at MIT at the time and was intrested in analyzing network speed by using queueing theory.
By doing this Kleinrock discovered how to speed up messages being transfered over a network by using demand access
and distributed control.
