# About

Hi we are Spencer and Tom we are currently graduate students here at NJIT who are close to finishing their
MS in Computer Science. We built this website in order to inform people about some of the more intresting
and obscure things that have occured during the development of the internet. We hope you find the history
of the internet to be as intrestingg to you as it is to us.
